# Academic Research Portfolio Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from academic and research-focused platforms like ResearchGate, academic personal websites, and modern scholarly portfolios. The design prioritizes credibility, readability, and professional presentation over visual flair.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
- **Primary Colors**: Deep academic blue (220 15% 25%) for headers and accents, complemented by crisp white backgrounds in light mode
- **Dark Mode**: Sophisticated dark navy (220 15% 12%) background with light text (220 10% 90%)
- **Accent Color**: Subtle teal (180 25% 45%) for links and interactive elements - used sparingly for publication highlights and call-to-action elements

### Typography
- **Primary Font**: Inter or similar modern sans-serif via Google Fonts for excellent readability
- **Headings**: Clean, professional hierarchy with generous spacing
- **Body Text**: Optimized for academic content consumption with appropriate line height (1.6-1.8)
- **Code/Technical**: Mono font for technical specifications and code snippets

### Layout System
- **Spacing**: Tailwind units of 4, 8, 12, and 16 (p-4, m-8, space-y-12, etc.) for consistent academic presentation
- **Grid**: Clean, structured layouts emphasizing content hierarchy
- **Sections**: Generous whitespace between major content areas

### Component Library
- **Navigation**: Fixed header with smooth scroll navigation to sections
- **Cards**: Clean publication and project cards with subtle shadows
- **Buttons**: Primary CTA buttons for downloads, minimal outline buttons for secondary actions
- **Forms**: Contact form with professional styling
- **Timeline**: Research experience presented chronologically
- **Skills Matrix**: Organized categorical display of technical competencies

## Content Structure
1. **Hero Section**: Professional introduction with key credentials and research focus
2. **Publications**: Detailed academic publications with abstracts and links
3. **Research Projects**: Interactive showcase of 8 major projects with technical depth
4. **Experience Timeline**: Academic and professional milestones
5. **Skills & Expertise**: Categorized technical competencies
6. **Contact & CV**: Professional contact information and downloadable resume

## Images
- **No Large Hero Image**: Professional headshot integrated subtly in the introduction
- **Project Thumbnails**: Technical diagrams, system architectures, and research visualizations
- **Publication Graphics**: Charts, graphs, and technical illustrations where relevant
- **Institution Logos**: Small, tasteful logos for UCL, conferences, and collaborations

## Visual Treatment
- **Minimal Animations**: Subtle fade-ins and smooth transitions only
- **Focus on Content**: Design serves the academic content without distraction
- **Professional Credibility**: Every element reinforces research expertise and academic rigor
- **Responsive Excellence**: Optimized for academic reviewers on various devices

The overall aesthetic should feel like a modern, digital academic portfolio that would impress PhD admissions committees and research hiring managers - sophisticated, content-rich, and professionally polished.
